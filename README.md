## Features
The project can retrive data from reddit and render in clear layout. It is mainly designed for simple using-experience, current functions demonstrated as  following:
- choose a popular category of topics as desired. 
- browse posts including topics, images and videos.
- upvote and downvote the topics.
- check out comments.
- local search by key words based on titles.

## More to come
Currently, it fetches data on webpages directly by json. As an result, posting function is absent for the moment. So, in the later version, it will be using API such that more interactive functions it will materialzie.
